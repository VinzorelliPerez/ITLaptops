Application Showcase / Demonstration: https://youtu.be/GG-F3zUfpwg

Future Plans:
Add a History panel to all the categories and make users sign in, keeping track on who updated each category.
Create a security feature (Admin Account) to only have access to set values.
Possibly track serial numbers.
Develop a submenu to give a tutorial on how Students should check laptops, handle, reimage, and verify the status.
Settings submenu for light mode, dark mode? Possibly Sign In Interface also?

The goal behind IT Laptops is to easily track laptops that move in and out of categories constantly.
